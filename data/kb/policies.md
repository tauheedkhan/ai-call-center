# Call Center Policies (Public Summary)

## 1. Authentication & Verification

- Agents must verify the caller using **two factors**: (a) name + customer ID (or last 4 of national ID) and (b) a dynamic account detail (e.g., last transaction, recent ticket ID).
- Agents **must not** request OTPs, full card numbers, PINs, or CVV.

## 2. Data Handling & Redaction

- PII is collected only as needed to serve the request.
- Transcripts and tickets automatically **redact** PAN, CVV, OTP, and passwords.
- Customers may request data export or deletion via privacy@domain.tld.

## 3. Refunds & Disputes

- **Eligibility:** duplicate charge, failed order, service not delivered, or service level breach.
- **Timeline:** Once approved, refunds are **processed in 5 business days**; posting times depend on the bank.
- **Disputes:** Must be raised within **60 days** of statement date. We provide a written outcome.

## 4. Tickets & Escalations

- Every request that cannot be resolved on the first call receives a ticket ID.
- Unresolved tickets older than **48 hours** auto‑escalate to Tier‑2; complex billing to Finance.
- Supervisors aim to respond to escalations **within 1 business day**.

## 5. SLAs & Communication

- **First Response:** < 60 seconds on voice during business hours; < 2 minutes on chat.
- **Containment Target:** ≥ 70% of inquiries resolved without escalation.
- Agents should confirm understanding, summarize next steps, and set expectations.

## 6. Call Recording & QA

- Calls may be recorded for training and quality. Sensitive data is redacted.
- Random QA audits are performed weekly; coaching is provided when needed.

## 7. Outages & Incidents

- During incidents, agents must reference the live status page and follow the approved script.
- Post‑incident, a customer‑facing summary is published within **24 hours**.

## 8. Hours of Operation
